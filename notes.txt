# Part 1: Reddit -> Zed
# Part 2: Zed -> Scikit-learn Model Training
# Part 3: Scikit-learn Model Inference -> Zed
# Part 4: Zed -> Result Querying and Visualization
# This can loop without losing any data since Zed provides persistence.
# Zed's schema flexibility will allow me to develop without stopping to curate schemas.

# Now that we have some stuff in a zpool, load it and run some models!
# This data will continue to grow as we ingest more reddit posts.
# We can run text models on the data, and persist the data in another zpool.
# Then we can query results from the zpool, and visualize them.
